HW8 solution
The file titled HW5_RQUDSI.ipynb gives the solution to the problems of assignment 8. The solution was developed from a skeleton ipython notebook file provided by the professor. Work was done along with the class mate Amey Rachel.

honestly there wasn't much to be done in this assignment, though I did learn a lot of things while doing it.
Carrying out the signal cleaning process was quite fascinating and I implemented the same for a different event (*LVT151012*). Whitening and bandpass method was interesting to learn as well.

Contribution: I worked on this assignemtn alone!
