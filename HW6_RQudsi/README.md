HW6 solution
The file titled HW5_RQUDSI.ipynb gives the solution to the problems of assignment 6. The solution was developed from a skeleton ipython notebook file provided by the professor. Work was done along with the class mate Amey Rachel.

Describing what we did
In this assignment we learnt to do various things.
1. Re-did the first part (assignment 5) and extracted all the features.
2. Looked at the TSNE plots for various different number of components for various different features.
3. Looked at the TSNE plots for various different cluster numbers and discussed the presence of outliers in the clusters.
4. Used two different distance metrics for clustering (Eucledian and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) and discussed the comparison.
5. Treated the dataset for two different surverys: the general survey, and the deep drilling fields.
6. Did the classification using random forest classifier package of sklearn.
7. Computed the score for different surveys and discussed what they mean.
8. Built the confusion matrix for both the random forest method as well as gradient boosted tree method and discussed what the confusion matrix mean in the context of classification or mis-calssification.

Almost all of the code was written with equal contribution from Amey Rachel, though I did make a few changes to the code later on!
