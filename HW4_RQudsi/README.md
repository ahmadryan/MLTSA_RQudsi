# Solution to assignment 4

### HW4 solution

The file titled **HW4_RQUDSI.ipynb** gives the solution to the problems of 
assignment 4. The solution was developed from a skeleton ipython notebook file
 provided by the professor. Work was done along with the class mate Amey Rachel.

#### Describing what we did

In this assignment we learnt to do various things.
 1. We learnt how to implement the MCMC model to fit a straight line to a set of 
 data under various different conditions, and for different siutuations. In one case
 we simply fit the data using simple method of polyfit algoritm of numpy.
 2. In the other case we looked at fitting the line with the understanding that 
 the data set has a bunch of outliers and weighted them against the probability 
 of each data point belonging to the line or not.
 3. In the other part of the assignment we looked at finding the point of change 
 using several different technique of maximizing the difference in the mean and
  the difference of variance around a point.
  4. We then used an acoustic data as provided by the professor (who was really
   nice to provide it in a very beautiful and perfect format), to find the point 
   of change using three different models from the **rupture** package.

#### Contribution detail

Almost all of the code was written with equal contribution from  Amey Rachel,
though I did make a few changes to the code later on!
