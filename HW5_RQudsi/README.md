HW5 solution
The file titled HW5_RQUDSI.ipynb gives the solution to the problems of assignment 5. The solution was developed from a skeleton ipython notebook file provided by the professor. Work was done along with the class mate Amey Rachel.

Describing what we did
In this assignment we learnt to do various things.
1. We learnt (re-learnt) to extract the data from Kaggle (download to a google drive folder and then extract it).
2. Plotted the flux curve for various objects.
3. Standardised the data.
4. Extracted several features like, mean, median, other higher order moments (skewness and kurtosis).
5. Extracted the mean and median of standardised data.
6. Separated the data in test and train using sklearn package
7. Scaleld the test and trained data
8. Did a 2D t-SNE projection for all the feature space

Almost all of the code was written with equal contribution from Amey Rachel, though I did make a few changes to the code later on!
